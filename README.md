**Why it exists**

Mica is a learning-sized, industrially-inspired language playground. It is
designed for readers who want to inspect a full compiler without wading through
millions of lines of code. Every subsystem is intentionally compact, documented,
and wired together so that you can:

- Study real implementations of lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, lowering,
  and code generation.
- Experiment with effect systems and deterministic concurrency on small,
  auditable programs.
- Prototype new ideas quickly while keeping the entire pipeline in view.

The repository doubles as a field guide: runnable examples, snapshot-tested
documentation, and a GitHub Pages site stay in sync with the CLI so that what
you read is what the compiler actually does. The project is intentionally small
enough to read in a weekend while still demonstrating the design patterns
required for a production-grade compiler.

### Who is Mica for?

- **Language tinkerers** who want to see how a complete front-end fits together
  without scaffolding a runtime or building infrastructure from scratch.
- **Educators** interested in a compact, auditable corpus they can walk through
  with a class or study group.
- **Systems programmers** exploring deterministic concurrency, capability
  tracking, and SSA-based lowering techniques in a familiar Rust codebase.

## Highlights at a glance

| Pillar | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Tiny but expressive core** | Learn the syntax in an afternoon and extend behaviour via standard libraries rather than bespoke keywords. |
| **Deterministic concurrency** | Structured `spawn`/`await` with effect tracking ensures reproducible outcomes and debuggable traces. |
| **Capability-based effects** | Explicit `using` clauses make side effects and resource access auditable for reviews and teaching. |
| **Ahead-of-time tooling** | One CLI binary surfaces every compiler stage, each backed by snapshot tests in [`docs/snippets.md`](docs/snippets.md). |
| **Interop-friendly ABI** | C-compatible calling conventions and hooks for Python/JavaScript ‚Äúforeign tasks‚Äù keep the language ecosystem-friendly. |

## Project status

Mica is a prototype under active design. Today the repository contains:

- A lexer, parser, resolver, effect checker, lowerer, and pretty-printer wired
  together behind a single CLI binary (`mica`).
- Exhaustiveness checking for `match` expressions, capability tracking, and
  structured diagnostics with source-code snippets.
- Snapshot-driven documentation for the CLI, plus a tutorial-oriented language
  tour.
- An executable test suite covering lexing, parsing, resolving, lowering,
  formatting, and both textual/native backend paths.

See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for the longer-term build-out and current areas of
focus.

## Choose your path

Pick the workflow that matches your goal today:

- **Skim the architecture** ‚Äî Start with the [repository layout](#repository-layout)
  and open the corresponding modules in `src/` to see how each stage is wired.
- **Observe the compiler in motion** ‚Äî Run a program with `--tokens`, `--ast`,
  or `--ir` flags (see [CLI reference](#cli-reference)) and compare the output
  against [`docs/snippets.md`](docs/snippets.md).
- **Learn the language surface** ‚Äî Read [`docs/tour.md`](docs/tour.md) alongside
  the programs in [`examples/`](examples/); every section links back to runnable
  code.
- **Track project health** ‚Äî Check [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) for the
  latest verification coverage and roadmap highlights.
- **Hack on a feature** ‚Äî Review [Development workflow](#development-workflow)
  and [Roadmap](#roadmap), then open an issue or draft PR with your experiment.

## Quickstart

Get a working environment and your first compiler run in minutes.

### 1. Install prerequisites

- Install a recent stable Rust toolchain via <https://rustup.rs/>.
- LLVM ships with Rust, so no additional native dependencies are required for
  this prototype.

### 2. Clone, build, and smoke-test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sir-Teo/mica.git
cd mica
cargo build
cargo test
```

`cargo test` exercises lexing, parsing, lowering, the IR pipeline, and snapshot
comparisons so you can trust subsequent experiments.

### 3. Explore the CLI

- Inspect the AST of a demo program:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin mica -- examples/demo.mica
  ```

- Compile and execute one of the runnable samples end-to-end:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin mica -- --run examples/methods.mica
  ```

Need a refresher on the available stages? Run `cargo run --bin mica -- --help`
for an up-to-date flag list. Prefer to experiment without leaving your editor?
Pair the commands above with `cargo watch -x "run --bin mica -- --run <file>"`
for tight feedback loops (install via `cargo install cargo-watch`).

### Troubleshooting

- If builds fail due to an outdated toolchain, run `rustup update` and retry.
- Regenerate CLI snapshots when golden files drift: `cargo run --bin gen_snippets`.
- Use `cargo clean` to clear stale build artifacts when switching toolchains.

## CLI reference

The CLI surfaces multiple compiler stages behind feature flags. Combine them as
needed:

```bash
cargo run --bin mica -- --tokens examples/demo.mica      # Lex the source file
cargo run --bin mica -- --ast examples/demo.mica         # Parse into an AST (default mode)
cargo run --bin mica -- --ast --pretty examples/adt.mica # Pretty-print the AST
cargo run --bin mica -- --resolve examples/adt.mica      # Inspect bindings and capabilities
cargo run --bin mica -- --check examples/adt.mica        # Exhaustiveness checks
cargo run --bin mica -- --lower examples/methods.mica    # Lower to the simple HIR
cargo run --bin mica -- --ir examples/methods.mica       # Dump the typed SSA IR via the backend shim
cargo run --bin mica -- --llvm examples/methods.mica     # Emit the LLVM scaffolding preview
cargo run --bin mica -- --build examples/methods.mica    # Produce a native binary next to the source
cargo run --bin mica -- --run examples/methods.mica      # Compile + run via the native backend
cargo run --bin mica -- --run --trace-json - examples/methods.mica # Run and emit a runtime trace to stdout
```

CLI output snapshots are maintained in [`docs/snippets.md`](docs/snippets.md).

### Editor integration

A dedicated language server is still in development. In the meantime, the
pretty-printer, CLI snapshots, and `cargo fmt` keep code style consistent.

## Language features

### Quick example

The following snippet demonstrates pattern matching and capability-aware
logging. Save it as `hello.mica` and run `cargo run --bin mica -- --run hello.mica`:

```mica
module hello

capability Console

func main(using Console console) -> Result[Int, Error] {
  let hour = 17
  let message = match hour {
    hour if hour < 12 -> "Good morning"
    hour if hour < 18 -> "Good afternoon"
    _                 -> "Good evening"
  }

  console.println(message)
  Ok(0)
}
```

The example highlights Mica's explicit capabilities and exhaustive `match`
expressions, even in small standalone modules.

### Feature highlights

- **Modules & namespaces** ‚Äî `module` declarations map directly to file system
  layout, simplifying code navigation.
- **Algebraic data types (ADTs)** ‚Äî First-class enums with pattern matching and
  guard clauses.
- **Deterministic concurrency** ‚Äî `spawn`, `await`, and effect-scoped `using`
  blocks keep asynchronous flows auditable.
- **Generics & traits** ‚Äî Zero-cost abstractions with trait-constrained
  generics and higher-order functions.
- **Capabilities & effects** ‚Äî Resources are granted explicitly, keeping IO,
  logging, and networking opt-in.

## Example gallery

The `examples/` directory showcases the current surface of the language, each
paired with a section in the tour:

- `adt.mica` ‚Äî defining algebraic data types and matching over them.
- `concurrency_pipeline.mica` ‚Äî coordinated `spawn`/`await` workflows, pattern
  matching, and capability-aware logging.
- `effects_and_using.mica` ‚Äî explicit capabilities with RAII `using` blocks.
- `effects_resource_pool.mica` ‚Äî higher-order helpers that combine `using`,
  structured error propagation, and cross-capability tasks.
- `comprehensive_deployment.mica` ‚Äî an end-to-end workflow that mixes
  concurrency, nested `using` scopes, and result propagation across a deployment
  plan.
- `native_entry.mica` ‚Äî a minimal module with an entry point that exercises the
  native `--build`/`--run` workflow end-to-end.
- `generics_tree_algorithms.mica` ‚Äî recursive ADTs with higher-order generic
  functions and trait bounds in action.
- `lists_and_loops.mica` ‚Äî collections, loops, and iteration patterns.
- `methods.mica` ‚Äî `impl` blocks and method receivers.

Use the CLI commands above to inspect each example and explore how the
capabilities compose across files. Pair them with the [language tour](#documentation--resources)
or the [GitHub Pages walkthrough](https://mica-lang.github.io/mica/) for guided
explanations.

## Development workflow

1. Make changes to the compiler or examples.
2. Format and lint your work:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
   ```
3. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
4. Update CLI snapshots when relevant:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin gen_snippets -- --check   # verify
   cargo run --bin gen_snippets              # regenerate if needed
   ```

Continuous integration mirrors this workflow, so keeping the tree clean ensures
fast reviews.

### Recommended tooling

- `cargo check` for quick iteration loops.
- `cargo fmt --check` in CI environments to verify formatting.
- An editor with rust-analyzer or language-server support for Rust will surface
  type errors as you work on the compiler.

## Roadmap

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few tips:

- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo test` before submitting a change.
- Update snapshots with `cargo run --bin gen_snippets` when CLI output changes
  (use `-- --check` to verify they are current).
- Prefer small, focused pull requests so reviews stay fast and friendly.
- Open an issue to discuss ideas, questions, or areas where you would like to
  help.

Community discussion channels (such as GitHub Discussions) will come online as
the project matures‚Äîwatch the repository for updates.

## FAQ

### Is Mica production ready?

Not yet. The language is still iterating on core semantics and tooling. Expect
breaking changes between releases.

### Does Mica target a virtual machine or native code?

Mica lowers to a typed SSA IR and emits LLVM IR for native code generation. A
bytecode or WASM backend may appear in future roadmap milestones.

### Where can I ask questions or follow along?

Track issues and discussions in the GitHub repository, or open an issue to start
a conversation. News about community chat channels will land in the roadmap
directory as they become available.
