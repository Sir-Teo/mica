# Documentation and Examples

## Scope

This guide covers the written documentation under `docs/` and the executable
example programs under `examples/`. Together they explain the language surface
and demonstrate how the compiler behaves, while aligning closely with the
roadmap’s communication and ecosystem milestones.

## Documentation Assets

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/tour.md` | Tutorial-style walkthrough of modules, ADTs, effects, concurrency, generics, and CLI usage, with inline references to runnable examples.【F:docs/tour.md†L1-L100】 |
| `docs/snippets.md` | Curated CLI outputs generated by `gen_snippets`, keeping the docs synchronized with the current compiler behavior.【F:docs/snippets.md†L1-L40】【F:src/bin/gen_snippets.rs†L1-L60】 |
| `docs/roadmap/` | Detailed milestone planning across compiler, tooling, and ecosystem tracks; serves as the canonical reference for aligning module work.【F:docs/roadmap/index.md†L1-L60】 |
| `docs/module_reference.md` | Index of module guides (this series of files) to help contributors dive into specific subsystems.【F:docs/module_reference.md†L1-L18】 |

## Examples Directory

- `examples/` contains runnable `.mica` programs that the README and tour link to
  for hands-on exploration of the language surface.【F:README.md†L63-L98】
- Notable samples include ADT definitions, capability-checked IO, structured
  concurrency, methods, and list processing, mirroring topics in the tour.【F:README.md†L86-L98】
- These examples double as fixtures for tests and CLI snapshots, ensuring
  documentation and regression suites stay in sync.【F:src/tests/helpers.rs†L1-L19】【F:docs/snippets.md†L1-L40】

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Tooling Milestones:** The roadmap emphasizes high-quality documentation and
  IDE integrations; snapshot-driven guides and example-driven tours are the
  foundation for that strategy.【F:docs/roadmap/tooling.md†L1-L60】
- **Ecosystem Growth:** Examples evolve into package templates and learning
  materials as the ecosystem roadmap advances toward package management and
  community onboarding.【F:docs/roadmap/ecosystem.md†L1-L78】

## Next Steps

- Expand the tour with deeper sections on generics, modules, and concurrency as
  new language features ship.
- Automate validation that every example compiles and is referenced from at least
  one document or test.
- Publish changelogs or release notes alongside roadmap milestones to keep users
  informed of progress.
