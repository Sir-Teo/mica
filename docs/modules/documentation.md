# Documentation and Examples

> The written guides and runnable programs stay in lockstep through automation
> and snapshot testing.

## Overview

The `docs/` directory explains the language, while `examples/` provides runnable
programs that appear throughout the README, tour, and tests. Snapshot tooling
keeps both assets accurate as the compiler evolves.

## Documentation Assets

- **Language tour** (`docs/tour.md`) – A narrative walkthrough of modules, ADTs,
  effects, concurrency, generics, and CLI usage.
- **Snippets** (`docs/snippets.md`) – Curated CLI output generated by
  `gen_snippets`, ensuring commands shown in the docs match reality.
- **Roadmap** (`docs/roadmap/`) – Tracks milestones across compiler, tooling, and
  ecosystem workstreams so contributors understand priorities.
- **Module reference** (`docs/module_reference.md`) – Index of subsystem guides to
  help readers dive into specific areas of the codebase.

## Examples Directory

- `examples/*.mica` programs demonstrate language features referenced in the
  README and tour.
- These samples double as fixtures for tests and CLI snapshots, keeping
  documentation and regression suites aligned.
- Topics include algebraic data types, capability-checked IO, structured
  concurrency, methods, and list processing.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Tooling milestones** rely on accurate documentation and machine-verified
  snippets to support IDE integrations.
- **Ecosystem growth** builds on example programs, evolving them into starter
  templates and community tutorials.

## Next Steps

- Expand the tour as new language features ship, especially around generics,
  modules, and concurrency patterns.
- Automate checks that every example compiles and is referenced from at least one
  document or test.
- Publish lightweight changelogs alongside roadmap updates to keep readers
  informed of progress.
