# Module Reference Index

This index links to deep-dive documentation for every major compiler and tooling
module in the Mica repository. Each module guide explains the component's
responsibilities, the most important types and entry points, and how the current
implementation maps to the milestones in the project roadmap found under
[`docs/roadmap/`](roadmap/index.md).

## Guides

- [CLI and Developer Tooling](modules/cli.md)
- [Diagnostics Infrastructure](modules/diagnostics.md)
- [Syntax Front-End](modules/syntax.md)
- [Semantic Analysis](modules/semantics.md)
- [Lowering Pipeline](modules/lowering.md)
- [SSA Intermediate Representation](modules/ir.md)
- [Testing Harness](modules/testing.md)
- [Documentation and Examples](modules/documentation.md)

Refer back to this index whenever you need to orient yourself across the
compiler pipeline or to understand how upcoming roadmap work will extend each
area.
