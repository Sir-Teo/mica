# Mica Implementation Roadmap

[← Back to Documentation Home](../index.html)

> Planning notes for the compiler, tooling, and ecosystem tracks.

This directory captures the actionable plans that turn the language vision into
working software. It is organised into:

- [`compiler.md`](compiler.md) – Deep dives for each compiler module with
  deliverables, dependencies, and risks.
- [`tooling.md`](tooling.md) – CLI, formatter, IDE/LSP, and developer experience
  milestones.
- [`ecosystem.md`](ecosystem.md) – Standard library growth, package management,
  and interoperability work.
- [`milestones.md`](milestones.md) – Chronological playbook that stitches the
  tracks into shippable phases.
- [`next-step.md`](next-step.md) – Immediate actions to keep the project moving
  forward.

Each file ends with explicit exit criteria and forward-looking signals so we can
recognise when a phase is complete and whether we remain aligned with the long-
term vision. Keep these documents in sync with the codebase—they are the living
source of truth for planning.
