# Mica Implementation Roadmap

This directory captures the actionable plans that turn the language vision into a working toolchain while keeping an eye on the
next decade of language design. It is organized into:

- [`compiler.md`](compiler.md) — deep dives for each compiler module with deliverables, dependencies, and risk notes.
- [`tooling.md`](tooling.md) — CLI, formatter, IDE/LSP, and developer-experience milestones.
- [`ecosystem.md`](ecosystem.md) — standard library growth, package management, and interoperability tracks.
- [`milestones.md`](milestones.md) — the chronological playbook that stitches everything together into ship-ready phases.

Every file closes with explicit exit criteria **and** forward-looking signals so we know when a phase is complete and whether
we’re still aligned with the long-term vision. Keep these documents in sync with the codebase; treat them as the living “source
of truth” for planning and language research.
